    intro: 'Identity theft can destroy your credit overnight with fraudulent accounts, unauthorized inquiries, and fake addresses. But victims have powerful legal protections under the FCRA and Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act. Here\'s how to restore your credit and protect yourself going forward.',
    problemExplanation: `Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information—Social Security number, name, address—to open credit accounts, make purchases, or commit fraud in your name. The damage can include fraudulent accounts, collections for debts you never incurred, hard inquiries you didn\'t authorize, and addresses you\'ve never lived at.

Under the FCRA, identity theft victims have enhanced rights including extended fraud alerts (7 years), free credit freezes, and the right to block fraudulent information from their credit reports permanently. The key is acting quickly and documenting everything.`,
    steps: [
      { title: 'File an FTC Identity Theft Report', text: 'Go to IdentityTheft.gov and file an official report. This creates your Identity Theft Report, which gives you enhanced rights with creditors and credit bureaus.' },

      { question: 'What\'s the difference between fraud alert and credit freeze?', answer: 'Fraud alerts warn lenders to verify identity before issuing credit (1 year, or 7 years for victims). Freezes completely block new credit access until you lift them.' },

    problemExplanation: `A judgment is a court order establishing that you legally owe a debt. Since 2017, judgments don\'t appear on credit reports due to data accuracy concerns. However, they create other problems: creditors can garnish wages, levy bank accounts, and place liens on property.

Judgments remain enforceable for years (varies by state, often 10-20 years) and can be renewed. The underlying debt that led to the judgment may also appear on credit reports as a collection or charge-off. Addressing both the judgment and related credit items is important.`,
